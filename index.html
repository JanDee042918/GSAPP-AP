			<p class="description">Based on a previous <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7595728/GSAPP6mGrad.pdf">survey</a> of the 2012 Masters of Architecture class, the GSAPP - ALUMNI PROJECT attempts to capture the state and evolution of GSAPP Alumni five years out. By comparing and contrasting the different disciplines and classes, it provides insight into GSAPP classes and helps record the paths GSAPP graduates have taken.<br><br>The initial questionaire was sent out to more than 3,500 graduates, over the months of February and March 2014, and it included questions about their...<br><br>Overall data (descriptive stats of the survey): Here is where we say that GSAPP has this many peeps and that every program has these many peeps and that our survey had this percentage and that even though it seems small we can say that it is representative. Now, whe we look at specific programs in specific years, then we should tread carefully because the sample is too small, but the conclusions are still meaningful.</p>

			<p class="description">One of the first things we can talk about is the gender of the people who responded. Do they correspond to the gender split in GSAPP??? That's a good question... Two interesting things, though: One, the gender split varies a lot. M.Archs and AADs are pretty balanced, but majors like HP and MS.RED have a big imbalance. The other thing is the age. The AADs seem like they are younger, which contradicts a little bit what one would think, because it's supposed to be a "post-professional" degree. Anyways, stuff like that...</p>

			<p class="description">Next is the nationality of the peeps, or the place where they lived before comming to GSAPP. This one is a little tricky because of the size of the regions. Asia might be the largest geographic region but it's not necessarily the one where the most people come from, that would be the Northeast region. Also, the US was split into regions, otherwise it would overwhel the whole map and we also think it's more useful to show it like that...</p>
