			<h2>Surveying 5 years of alumni from the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University.</h2>
			<p class="description" id="intro1">
				GSAPP.AP visualizes the responses of 5 years of GSAPP graduates in an attempt to capture and analyze the state and evolution of the school's alumni. Based on a previous <a class="contact" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7595728/GSAPP6mGrad.pdf" target="_blank">survey</a> of the 2012 Masters of Architecture class, GSAPP.AP compares the different disciplines and graduating classes that make up the school, thus providing insights into the school's professions and helping record the different paths its graduates have taken.<br><br>The initial questionnaire was sent out to more than 1,900 graduates, over the months of February and March 2014, and it included questions about their background, their job search, their current jobs and their views towards the future. Here we present their responses, hoping not only to provide valuable insights into the graduates themselves but also to study, analyze and question the professions they have chosen and the school as a center for education and professional formation.<br><br>For reference, the acronyms used here signify the following: M.Arch - Masters in Architecture; MS.AAD - Masters of Science in Advanced Architectural Design; MS.AUD - Masters of Science in Advanced Urban Design; MS.HP - Masters of Science in Historic Preservation; MS.RED - Masters of Science in Real Estate Development; MS.UP - Masters of Science in Urban Planning; Other includes double majors as well as PH.Ds and students in the Masters in Critical Curatorial and Conceptual Practices.

				Even though the survey was sent to all GSAPP alumni graduating between 2009 and 2013, only 23% of graduates answered the questions. However, small as this might be, this still constitutes a meaningful sample and provides valuable information.

				Overall, the class that had the highest response rate was the M.Arch from 2013, with over 50% of the graduates responding the survey. That being said, there were some classes with too few responses, so caution is warranted when interpreting some of the results. Here's the comparison between 5 years of GSAPP graduates as a whole, and those who responded to our survey.

				Overall, students come to GSAPP with very similar academic backgrounds, mostly from undergraduate degrees similar to their graduate field of study. For example, more than 80% of the M.Arch students have an undergrad in a similar field. As for the MS.AADs and MS.AUDs, since they are 'post-professional' degrees, 100% of the students have a background in a similar field. However, the one exception is the Urban Planning program, where more than 40% of the students come from humanities, science or social sciences.

				In terms of age and gender, the split is pretty even, with slightly more women than men (50.5% vs 49.5%). However, certain fields are much more imbalanced than that. For example, in Historic Preservation the split is 84% women vs. 16% men and in Real Estate Development it is 71% men vs. 29% women. Overall, the M.Archs, MS.AADs and MS.AUDs are pretty well balanced and the Urban Planning program has a 66% women vs. 34% men split.

				Finally, most students come into GSAPP with some professional experience in their chosen field of study. In most cases, over 50% of the students have more than a year of experience with the exception of Historic Preservation, where only around 40% fulfill this condition.<p>

In all cases though, there is a percentage of students that come into GSAPP with no professional experience in their chosen field of study, Urban Planning and Historic Preservation having the highest rates (29% and 28%).

			<p class="description">
				Most GSAPP graduates come from the North East of the United States. However, this varies greatly when looking at the specific majors. For example, a great portion of MS.AADs come from Europe and Asia, as well as MS.AUDs. Urban Planning, Historic Preservation and Real Estate Development are almost entirely made up of people from the U.S. Finally, out of all the continents, Africa is consistently the most underrepresented.<br><br>In terms of where people go to after graduating, it's a very different story, with almost 85% of graduates staying in the U.S., again, almost exclusively in the North East. Out of all the majors, the MS.AUDs are the ones with the highest proportion of graduates leaving the U.S. (19%), whereas the M.Arch and Historic Preservation degrees keep more than 90% of their graduates in the U.S.

				Getting a job after grad-school is always a daunting challenge and even though GSAPP enjoys a very good reputation in the professional world many students struggle finding employment when they finish their degree. This is specially true for the last 5 years of GSAPP graduates, having had to live through one of the worst economic downturns in the history of the profession.

				</table>
			</div>
			<p class="description">
				Nevertheless, there is still a lot of variation between the different majors in the school, and this can be seen both in the number of job applications sent and in the number of interviews the graduates went through before finding a job.<br><br>For instance, more than half of the M.Arch graduates sent less than 10 job applications and only 10% of them sent more than 50, while around 30% of the MS.AADs and MS.AUDs had to send more than 50 applications before getting a job. Similarly, almost 40% of the Real Estate Graduates went through more than 5 interviews before getting a job, while only 11% of the M.Archs had to do this.
			</p>

					</tr>	
				</table>
			</div>
			<p class="description">
				In addition to job applications and interviews, another interesting difference between the majors can be seen in who helped the graduates get a job. For example, in the case of the M.Archs, 36% of them got a job with help from a GSAPP professor, and 23% of them had help from a GSAPP friend. However, only around 12% of the MS.AADs or Urban Planners found a job thanks to a GSAPP professor.<br><br>Overall, though, the most common response to 'who helped you find a job' was 'nobody', with 40% of the cases. This speaks very highly of the graduates' resourcefulness but not so well of the networks they are able to build at the school. Additionally, the lack of help from GSAPP Career Services (with the exception to that provided to Real Estate graduates) is extremely worrying.

				<iframe scrolling="no" src="p5_job_who.html" class="p5_chart" width="650" height="260" frameborder="0"></iframe>
			</p>
			<p class="description">
				Finally, even though this cohort of graduates had to face very difficult economic conditions, most of the people found jobs within 3 months of graduating. Again, the M.Archs and the Real Estate graduates seem to be the ones that struggled the least, with the great majority of them finding a job in less than 3 months. On the other hand, more than half of the MS.AUDs and  Historic Preservation students found a job only after 3 months.<br><br>In addition, another big difference, which certainly plays a role in finding a job, is the visa requirements for a lot of the graduates. Around half of the MS.AAD and MS.AUD require a visa to work in the U.S., while only around 10% of the Urban Planners or M.Archs do.</p>

					</tr>	
				</table>
			</div>
			<p class="description">
				It is also very important to note that 49% of the visas were not paid for by the employer but by the GSAPP graduate. U.S. immigration law, however, states very clearly that visas should not be paid for by the employees.

				Even though talking about salaries can be difficult, we feel that having more information and transparency on this subject is always welcomed. Specially for young graduates, knowing what other people in similar positions make can be an invaluable tool when negotiating their first salary right out of grad-school.

			<p class="description">
				Overall, our survey shows that most people make between $40,000 and $70,000 with a great portion concentrated between $50,000 and $60,000. However, this varies greatly both in terms of the specific majors and when looking at how much time has passed since graduating. For example, the great majority of Real Estate Development grads make more than $100,000 per year, while in the rest of the disciplines less than 4% of graduates make more than $100,000 per year.

			<p class="description">
				In addition to the differences in salaries between the different majors, our survey also shows a disparity between how much men and women make in each profession. Overall, we see 16% of men making more than $100,000 while only 5% of women make this much and only in Urban Planning is there a greater proportion of women than men in the top range of salaries. In all other disciplines men make on average more than women.

				In terms of software it is surprising how few people use the advanced programs learned during their time in grad-school. For example, less than 25% of GSAPP grads use 3DS Max, Grasshopper, Revit or ArcGIS at work, and less than 5% use Maya, Catia or Processing. By far the most widely used softwares are the Adobe Creative Suite (around 70% of graduates use it) and Microsoft Word and Excel (used by around 85%).<br><br>There are also big differences between the types of software used by the different majors and by the different salary ranges. Real Estate graduates, for example, use almost exclusively Word, Excel and PowerPoint, while M.Archs, MS.AADs and MS.AUDs use a combination of Adobe Creative Suite, with 2D and 3D modeling software (Rhino and AutoCAD) and Microsoft Office. Finally, the more you move up in salary, the less people use scripting or 3D modeling and the more Microsoft Office and the Adobe Creative Suite dominate the field. It doesn't seem to hold that knowing very specialized software gets you higher up in terms of salary.

				As much as architects and people in related fields like to complain about the long working hours, the data collected in this software doesn't necessarily confirm those complaints. Overall, most people work between 40 and 60 hours a week, and this seems to be true for most GSAPP majors, with the exception of Real Estate (who report working longer hours) and Historic Preservation (working less hours).<br><br>In regards to salary, also, there doesn't seem to be a very strong correlation between working more hours and making more money. Yes, the people who make more than $100,000 tend to work longer hours, but below that most people seem to be in the same range of hours per week.

				Since almost half of GSAPP graduates major in Architecture or Advanced Architectural Design it is only normal that more than 50% of graduates should be doing architecture at their companies. However, there's also a large portion of graduates that do interior design (something GSAPP students do very little of), and there is also some graduates who go on to do graphic design (9.3%), engineering (10.9%) and data visualization (6.4%), all fields that are not specifically studied in school.

				Company size varies a lot by major, with most people working either for large firms with more than 100 employees (35%) or in small to medium firms with less than 50 employees. The M.Archs, MS.AADs and MS.AUDs all maintain these proportions, but the Real Estate and Urban Planning graduates tend to work overwhelmingly in companies that have more than 100 employees, while the Historic Preservation ones tend to work more in small firms with less than 10 employees.

				Overtime payment seems to be another sticky issue with GSAPP graduates with almost 50% of firms not compensating at all for extra time. In fact, only 15% of firms pay their employees overtime, and the rest compensate them with various perks, like throwing an occasional office party, paying for dinner and cabs home when they stay late, or giving them extra vacation days. The most extreme case is Real Estate Development, where almost 60% of firms don't compensate at all, while at the other end of the spectrum is Urban Planning, with 31% of firms paying for extra time.

				Even though these past 5 years have been very difficult for GSAPP professions most graduates seem to have stable jobs with 82% of them employed full-time and only 3.5% either unemployed, interning or only part-time employed. However, it is interesting to see that overall 13.5% of graduates have different work status: they are either working full-time and freelancing at the same time, or just freelancing, or have become independent and own their own business. In this regard, the class of 2010 sticks out, with more than 20% of graduates describing themselves as freelancing or self-employed.<br><br>In terms of how many jobs graduates have had since graduating, the norm seems to be one or two, even for the people who graduated in 2009. That being said, we do see an increase in the number of jobs people have had, as we move backwards from class to class.

				In terms of licensing there seems to be an overall desire to get licensed in the next 3 years, however, there's also a great portion of graduates who either don't have concrete plans for licensing or are just not interested in doing it. Specifically, the MS.AUDs and the MS.AADs seem to be a little more indifferent towards the licensing process, even though there is still a great number of them who do want to get licensed. One reason for this might be that a lot of them are already licensed in their country of origin or that some of them don't plan to stay permanently in the U.S.<br><br>In addition, there seems to be some confusion in certain fields as to whether or not there is an official license. For example, 16% of Urban Planning graduates say that there's no official license while 28% of them say that they will get licensed in the next 3 years.

				From all the disciplines, though, the ones with the most entrepreneurial spirit seem to be the MS.AAD with more than half of the graduates wanting to have their own businesses in the next five years. The Urban Planners, on the other hand, would mostly like to be in the same company.

				Concluding the analysis of the survey, GSAPP graduates are mostly employed in the field of their choosing, live on the eastern coast of the United States, and have ambitions of advancing in their respected professions. Although their are outliers graduates tend to be satisfied with their education and have been consistently employed since graduating. This survey is meant to examine why Alumni choose GSAPP for their professional education and how they have shaped their careers in the last 5 years.<br></br>We thank both the GSAPP administration and the alumni network for their support and outreach to the alumni population as well as former Dean Mark Wigley and current Dean Amale Andraos for their support.
